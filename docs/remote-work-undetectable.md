## Understanding How Location Detection Works

Before we dive into solutions, let's understand the fundamental concepts. This knowledge will help you make informed decisions and troubleshoot issues.

### What is an IP Address?

Think of an IP address like your home's postal address, but for the internet. When you connect to the internet, your Internet Service Provider (ISP) assigns you a unique number that identifies your location.

**Example**: When you're in Uberaba, your IP might be `201.49.148.123`. When you travel to Tokyo, you'll get a different IP like `126.227.123.45`.

**Why this matters**: Every website, app, and service can see your IP address and determine your approximate location.

### How Companies Detect Your Location

Understanding these methods helps you avoid detection:

#### 1. **Public IP Address** (Most Important)

- **What it is**: Your internet "address" assigned by your ISP
- **How it works**: ISPs assign IP ranges to specific geographic regions
- **Detection**: Services look up your IP in databases to find your location
- **Example**: IP `201.49.148.123` = Uberaba, Minas Gerais, Brazil

#### 2. **DNS Server Location**

- **What it is**: DNS (Domain Name System) translates website names to IP addresses
- **How it works**: Your device asks DNS servers "What's the IP for google.com?"
- **Detection**: Services can see which DNS servers you're using
- **Example**: Using Google DNS (8.8.8.8) from Tokyo reveals you're not in Brazil

#### 3. **WebRTC Leaks**

- **What it is**: WebRTC allows browsers to communicate directly
- **How it works**: Browsers can reveal your real IP even through VPNs
- **Detection**: Websites can force your browser to reveal your actual location
- **Example**: A website can detect your real IP even if you're using a VPN

#### 4. **Time Zone Settings**

- **What it is**: Your device's clock and timezone configuration
- **How it works**: Apps check your system timezone to infer location
- **Detection**: Being in "Tokyo time" while claiming to be in Brazil is suspicious
- **Example**: Teams showing "Last seen at 2:00 AM Tokyo time" while you claim to be in Brazil

#### 5. **Device Posture**

- **What it is**: Information about your device and network
- **How it works**: Apps check for VPN software, unusual network patterns
- **Detection**: Corporate tools can detect VPN usage, multiple network connections
- **Example**: AnyConnect detecting other VPN software running

### The VPN Detection Problem

Most people think VPNs make them invisible, but they actually make you more detectable:

#### Commercial VPN Issues

- **Shared IPs**: Hundreds of users share the same IP address
- **Data Center IPs**: Easy to identify as "not residential"
- **Pattern Recognition**: Corporate tools learn to detect VPN traffic
- **Blacklisting**: IPs get flagged and blocked

#### Why Home Egress is Superior

- **Unique IP**: Only you use your home IP address
- **Residential IP**: Impossible to flag as "data center"
- **No Patterns**: Looks exactly like normal home internet usage
- **Unblockable**: Your home IP can't be blacklisted

## Understanding VPNs and Tunneling

### What is a VPN?

VPN stands for "Virtual Private Network." Think of it as creating a secure tunnel through the internet.

**Simple Analogy**: Imagine you're in Tokyo but want to make a phone call that appears to come from your home in Uberaba. A VPN is like having a very long, invisible phone line that connects you directly to your home, so when you call someone, it looks like you're calling from home.

### How VPNs Work

1. **Your Device** (in Tokyo) connects to a **VPN Server** (in Uberaba)
2. **All your internet traffic** goes through this secure tunnel
3. **Websites and apps** see your traffic as coming from the VPN server location
4. **Your real location** is hidden from the outside world

### Types of VPNs

#### 1. **Commercial VPNs** (What Most People Use)

- **Examples**: PureVPN, NordVPN, ExpressVPN
- **How they work**: You connect to their servers around the world
- **Problem**: Hundreds of users share the same IP address
- **Detection**: Easy to identify as "VPN traffic"

#### 2. **Home Egress VPNs** (What We'll Use)

- **How they work**: You connect to your own home internet
- **Advantage**: Only you use your home IP address
- **Detection**: Impossible to identify as "VPN traffic"
- **Result**: Looks exactly like normal home internet usage

### The Tunneling Concept

**Tunneling** is the process of sending your internet traffic through a secure connection to another location.

```
Normal Internet Connection:
Your Device → Internet → Website
(Website sees your real location)

VPN Tunneling:
Your Device → VPN Tunnel → VPN Server → Internet → Website
(Website sees VPN server location)
```

### Why Home Egress is Superior

Commercial VPNs (like PureVPN) use shared IP addresses from data centers. These are easily flagged by:

- **Microsoft's geo-fencing systems**: Detects data center IPs
- **Teams/Zoom location detection**: Flags shared IP addresses
- **Corporate security tools**: Recognizes VPN patterns
- **Banking and financial services**: Blocks VPN traffic

Your home IP address is unique, residential, and impossible to flag as "VPN traffic."

### The ISP Provider Detection Method (Why Commercial VPNs Fail)

**Critical Understanding**: When you visit any website or use any app, it can see detailed information about your internet connection. This is what gives away commercial VPN usage.

#### How to Test This Yourself

1. Open your browser and visit: `https://whatismyipaddress.com`
2. Scroll down to the **"ISP Provider"** section
3. Look at what it says:

**With Home Internet** (Safe):
```
ISP Provider: Spectrum
or
ISP Provider: Verizon
or
ISP Provider: Xfinity
or
ISP Provider: Bell Canada
```

**With Commercial VPN** (DETECTED):
```
ISP Provider: NordVPN Server
or
ISP Provider: CyberGhost VPN
or
ISP Provider: ExpressVPN
or
ISP Provider: [VPN Company Name]
```

**With Site-to-Site VPN** (Safe - Undetectable):
```
ISP Provider: Spectrum  ← Your actual home ISP!
or
ISP Provider: Verizon   ← Looks like you're at home
```

#### Why This Matters for Corporate Detection

**What Corporate IT Sees**:
- Your company's security tools monitor this "ISP Provider" field
- If it shows "NordVPN Server" or any VPN service, **you're flagged immediately**
- If it shows your actual home ISP (Spectrum, Verizon, etc.), **you appear to be working from home**

**The Key Difference**:
- **Commercial VPN**: ISP field shows "VPN Server" → DETECTED
- **Site-to-Site VPN (GL.iNet)**: ISP field shows "Spectrum" → UNDETECTABLE

This is why the GL.iNet site-to-site VPN setup using your home router is **impossible to detect** - because you're literally using your actual home internet connection, just routing it through a secure tunnel to wherever you are in the world.

**Test Before You Travel**:
1. Set up your GL.iNet routers
2. Connect your laptop to the travel router
3. Visit `whatismyipaddress.com`
4. Verify ISP Provider shows your home ISP (Spectrum, Verizon, etc.)
5. If it shows "VPN" anywhere, something is wrong - troubleshoot before traveling!

## Method 1: WireGuard Home Server (Recommended - Most Foolproof)

### The Concept Explained Simply

Instead of using a commercial VPN, you create your own private tunnel to your home. Here's how it works:

**The Big Picture**: You set up a small computer at home (like a Raspberry Pi) that acts as your personal internet gateway. When you're traveling, all your internet traffic goes through this home device, making it appear you're still in Uberaba.

**Step-by-Step Flow**:

1. **You're in Tokyo** using your personal MacBook
2. **Your MacBook connects** to your GL.iNet travel router
3. **The router creates a secure tunnel** to your home device
4. **All internet traffic** (Teams, Zoom, web browsing) goes through this tunnel
5. **Websites and apps** see your traffic as coming from your home in Uberaba

```plaintext
Your Travel Location → GL.iNet Router → WireGuard → Home Spare Device → Internet
                                                      ↑
                                              All traffic appears
                                              to come from here
```

**Why This Works**:

- Your home device has your real home IP address
- Only you use this IP address (not shared with hundreds of people)
- It looks exactly like normal home internet usage
- Impossible to detect as "VPN traffic"

### What is WireGuard?

WireGuard is a modern VPN protocol that's:

- **Fast**: Much faster than older VPN protocols
- **Secure**: Uses state-of-the-art cryptography
- **Simple**: Easy to set up and maintain
- **Reliable**: Works consistently across different networks

**Think of it as**: A super-fast, secure highway between your travel location and your home.

### ⚠️ Company MacBook Security Warning

**DO NOT install VPN software on your company MacBook!** Corporate IT can:

- Monitor all installed applications
- Detect VPN software usage
- Flag suspicious network activity
- Require approval for software installations

**Safe Approach**: Use a separate device at home (old laptop, Raspberry Pi, etc.) as your WireGuard server.

### Prerequisites: What You Need Before Starting

Before diving into the setup, ensure you have these critical requirements:

#### 1. Home Internet Speed Requirements

**Critical**: Fast home internet is essential because you're sending network packets back and forth through routers with added latency.

**Minimum Requirements**:
- **Upload Speed**: 30 Mbps minimum (50+ Mbps recommended)
- **Download Speed**: 150-200+ Mbps minimum (300+ Mbps ideal)

**Why this matters**: The VPN tunnel adds latency. Fast internet compensates for this so your Zoom calls, Teams meetings, and video streaming work smoothly.

**How to test**: Visit `speedtest.net` from your home internet and verify both upload and download speeds meet these minimums.

#### 2. Ethernet Cables (Cat 6 Recommended)

**For Setup**: You'll need 3 ethernet cables total
- 2 short cables (2-3 feet) - usually come with routers
- 1 long cable (6-8 feet) for travel

**For Travel**: Get a **6-8 foot Cat 6 flat ethernet cable**
- **Why flat**: Easier to pack, doesn't tangle
- **Why 6-8 feet**: Airbnb/hotel routers often mounted high on walls or in closets
- **Why Cat 6**: Faster data transmission than Cat 5

**Recommended**: [AmazonBasics Cat 6 Flat Ethernet Cable, 6 feet](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cat+6+flat+ethernet+cable) (~$10)

#### 3. Trusted Location for Home Router

You need a **safe, stable location** to keep your home router running 24/7:
- Parent's house
- Trusted friend/family member's home
- Your own apartment (if maintaining it while traveling)

**Critical**: This device must remain **untouched and undisturbed** for the duration of your travels. No one should unplug it, reset it, or move it.

### Step-by-Step Setup

#### Part 1: Set Up Home WireGuard Server (Spare Device)

**Required Hardware**: Since you only have 2 laptops, you'll need a dedicated home server device

**What You're Building**: A small computer that stays at home and acts as your personal internet gateway. Think of it as a tiny server that handles all your internet traffic when you're traveling.

1. **Recommended Server Devices** (power outage safe):
   - **Raspberry Pi 5 + UPS** (recommended): $75 + $50 UPS = $125 total
     - *What it is*: A credit-card-sized computer perfect for this job
     - *Why it's good*: Low power consumption, reliable, easy to set up
     - *Power usage*: ~5 watts (your phone charger uses more power)

   - **Mini PC + UPS**: $150 + $50 UPS = $200 total  
     - *What it is*: A small desktop computer (about the size of a book)
     - *Why it's good*: More powerful, can handle multiple tasks
     - *Power usage*: ~15-25 watts

   - **Intel NUC + UPS**: $200 + $50 UPS = $250 total
     - *What it is*: Intel's small form factor computer
     - *Why it's good*: Very reliable, good performance
     - *Power usage*: ~20-30 watts

   - **Old laptop + UPS**: Free + $50 UPS = $50 total (if you have one)
     - *What it is*: Any old laptop you're not using
     - *Why it's good*: Free if you have one, but uses more power
     - *Power usage*: ~30-50 watts

2. **Install WireGuard Server** (using Docker for simplicity):

   **What is Docker?**: Docker is a tool that lets you run applications in isolated containers. Think of it as a way to install software without cluttering your system.

   **What is WireGuard Easy?**: It's a web-based interface that makes setting up WireGuard much easier. Instead of editing complex configuration files, you get a simple web page to manage everything.

   ```bash
   # On your spare device (NOT company MacBook)
   # Step 1: Install Docker
   curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
   sh get-docker.sh
   
   # Step 2: Run WireGuard Easy
   docker run -d \
     --name=wg-easy \
     -e WG_HOST=YOUR_HOME_IP \
     -e PASSWORD=YOUR_SECURE_PASSWORD \
     -v ~/.wg-easy:/etc/wireguard \
     -p 51820:51820/udp \
     -p 51821:51821/tcp \
     --cap-add=NET_ADMIN \
     --cap-add=SYS_MODULE \
     --sysctl="net.ipv4.conf.all.src_valid_mark=1" \
     --sysctl="net.ipv4.ip_forward=1" \
     weejewel/wg-easy
   ```

   **What this does**:
   - Installs Docker (the container system)
   - Downloads and runs WireGuard Easy
   - Creates a web interface at `http://YOUR_HOME_IP:51821`
   - Sets up the WireGuard server on port 51820

3. **Configure Port Forwarding**:

   **What is Port Forwarding?**: Your home router acts like a security guard. It only allows certain types of traffic to pass through. Port forwarding tells the router "allow WireGuard traffic on port 51820 to go to this specific device."

   **Why You Need It**: Without port forwarding, your travel router can't connect to your home server. It's like having a locked door - you need to give the router the key.

   **Step-by-Step**:
   - Access your Huawei modem admin panel (usually `192.168.1.1`)
   - Look for "Port Forwarding" or "Virtual Server" settings
   - Forward UDP port 51820 to your WireGuard server's IP
   - Set up DDNS (Dynamic DNS) for changing IP addresses

   **What is DDNS?**: Your home internet IP address changes occasionally. DDNS gives you a permanent address (like `myhome.ddns.net`) that always points to your current IP address.

4. **Set Up Power Outage Protection**:

   **What is a UPS?**: An Uninterruptible Power Supply is like a battery backup for your computer. When the power goes out, it keeps your devices running for a few hours.

   **Why You Need It**: If your home server goes offline, your entire remote work setup stops working. A UPS ensures it keeps running during power outages.

   **Components**:
   - **UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply)**: APC Back-UPS 600VA ($50)
     - *What it does*: Provides backup power during outages
     - *Runtime*: 2-4 hours for small devices like Raspberry Pi
     - *Protection*: Protects against power surges and brownouts

   - **Auto-restart**: Configure BIOS to power on after power restoration
     - *What it does*: Automatically turns on your server when power returns
     - *Why it's important*: You don't want to manually restart everything after an outage

   - **Monitoring**: Set up email alerts for power outages
     - *What it does*: Sends you an email when power goes out or comes back
     - *Why it's useful*: You know when your home server is offline

   - **Backup power**: Keep server running 2-4 hours during outages
     - *What it does*: Gives you time to finish work or switch to backup plan
     - *Typical outage*: Most power outages last 1-2 hours

5. **Configure Remote Access** (for troubleshooting):

   **Why You Need This**: When you're traveling and something breaks, you need a way to fix it remotely. You can't physically go home to restart your server.

   **What is SSH?**: SSH (Secure Shell) is like having a remote control for your computer. You can connect to your home server from anywhere and run commands to fix problems.

   **Components**:
   - **SSH access**: Enable SSH on your home server
     - *What it does*: Lets you connect to your server remotely
     - *How it works*: You type commands on your travel laptop, they execute on your home server
     - *Security*: Uses encryption to protect your connection

   - **Dynamic DNS**: Use No-IP or DuckDNS for changing IP addresses
     - *What it does*: Gives you a permanent address for your home server
     - *Why you need it*: Your home IP changes, but you need a consistent way to connect
     - *Example*: `myhome.ddns.net` always points to your current home IP

   - **VPN access**: Connect to home network to troubleshoot
     - *What it does*: Creates a secure connection to your home network
     - *When to use*: When you need to access other devices on your home network
     - *Security*: Encrypted connection protects your data

   - **Web interface**: WireGuard Easy provides web-based management
     - *What it does*: Gives you a web page to manage your WireGuard server
     - *Why it's useful*: No need to remember complex commands
     - *Access*: Available at `http://YOUR_HOME_IP:51821`

6. **Set Up Mouse Jiggler on Company MacBook** (safe - no VPN software):

   **What is a Mouse Jiggler?**: It's a program that keeps your computer "active" by simulating mouse movement or keyboard activity. This prevents your computer from going to sleep or showing as "away" in Teams.

   **Why You Need It**: When you're traveling, your company MacBook needs to stay active so it appears you're working from home. If it goes to sleep, Teams will show you as "away" or "offline."

   **Setup**:
   - Download "Amphetamine" from Mac App Store
   - Set to "Prevent computer from sleeping" mode
   - This keeps your MacBook active and prevents Teams from showing "away"

   **How It Works**: The app periodically moves your mouse cursor by 1 pixel, which is enough to keep the computer active without being noticeable.

7. **Configure Power Management**:

   **Why This Matters**: You want your company MacBook to stay on 24/7, but you also want it to be power-efficient and protected from power outages.

   **Settings**:
   - System Preferences → Energy Saver
   - Uncheck "Prevent computer from sleeping when plugged in"
   - Keep MacBook plugged in 24/7
   - **Connect to UPS**: Use UPS for both server and company MacBook

   **What This Does**:
   - Prevents the MacBook from sleeping when plugged in
   - Ensures it stays active 24/7
   - Protects it from power outages and surges
   - Keeps Teams status as "active" or "available"

#### Part 2: Configure Your Travel Router (GL.iNet)

**What is a Travel Router?**: A travel router is a small device that creates your own Wi-Fi network wherever you go. It connects to the internet (via hotel Wi-Fi, mobile hotspot, etc.) and then provides your own secure network for all your devices.

**Why You Need One**: Instead of connecting each device directly to hotel Wi-Fi or your phone's hotspot, you connect everything to your travel router. The router then handles the VPN connection, so all your devices automatically get the benefits.

**How It Works**:

1. **You connect** your travel router to hotel Wi-Fi or your phone's hotspot
2. **Your devices** (MacBook, phone, tablet) connect to the travel router
3. **The router** creates a secure tunnel to your home server
4. **All traffic** from all devices goes through this tunnel
5. **Result**: Every device appears to be using your home internet

**Recommended GL.iNet Models** (based on real-world speeds):

#### Travel Routers (Take With You)

| Model | WireGuard Speed | OpenVPN Speed | Price | Physical Size | Best For |
|-------|----------------|---------------|-------|---------------|----------|
| Beryl AX (GL-MT3000) | 200-300 Mbps | 70-100 Mbps | $80 | Shorter than iPhone, 3-4cm thick | Budget option, highly portable |

2. **Install Tailscale** package
3. **Configure exit node** directly on router
4. **Pros**: No extra hardware needed
5. **Cons**: Complex setup, risk of bricking router

### GL.iNet as Tailscale Client

1. **Install Tailscale** on GL.iNet:
   - More → Install Apps → Tailscale

2. **Sign in and Connect**:
   - Sign in with same Tailscale account
   - Select your home device as exit node

3. **Connect and Test**:
   - Enable Tailscale connection
   - Verify IP address shows home location

## Method 3: VPS Middlebox + WireGuard (If Home Setup Fails)

### When Home Setup Isn't Possible

If you can't set up a home server due to:

- No spare device available
- Complex home network (CGNAT, strict firewall)
- ISP blocks port forwarding
- Technical complexity concerns

**Solution**: Use a VPS (Virtual Private Server) as a relay to your home network.

### VPS Middlebox Setup

1. **Rent a VPS** (DigitalOcean, Linode, Vultr):
   - $5-10/month for basic VPS
   - Choose location close to your home (São Paulo region)

2. **Set up WireGuard on VPS**:

   ```bash
   # On VPS
   curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
   sh get-docker.sh
   
   docker run -d \
     --name=wg-easy \
     -e WG_HOST=VPS_IP \
     -e PASSWORD=YOUR_PASSWORD \
     -v ~/.wg-easy:/etc/wireguard \
     -p 51820:51820/udp \
     weejewel/wg-easy
   ```

3. **Configure Home Device**:
   - Install WireGuard client on spare device at home
   - Connect to VPS
   - Set up routing to forward traffic through home internet

4. **Pros**:
   - Works from anywhere
   - No port forwarding needed
   - Reliable connection

5. **Cons**:
   - Monthly cost ($5-10)
   - More complex setup
   - VPS IP may be flagged (less residential)

## Method 4: Commercial VPNs (Last Resort Only)

### PureVPN Assessment

**Effectiveness**: ⭐⭐☆☆☆ (2/5)

**Pros**:

- Easy setup
- Many server locations
- Affordable

**Cons**:

- Shared IP addresses easily flagged
- Microsoft geo-fencing detects VPN traffic
- Teams/Zoom may show "VPN detected" warnings
- Banking apps may block access
- Slower speeds due to server load

**When It Might Work**:

- For personal browsing only
- When home egress fails
- For accessing geo-blocked content (not work-related)

### Better Commercial VPN Options

If you must use a commercial VPN:

| VPN | Dedicated IP | Residential IPs | Price/Month | Effectiveness |
|-----|-------------|----------------|-------------|--------------|
| ProtonVPN | ✅ | ❌ | $10 | ⭐⭐⭐☆☆ |
| Mullvad | ❌ | ❌ | €5 | ⭐⭐☆☆☆ |
| IVPN | ✅ | ❌ | $10 | ⭐⭐⭐☆☆ |
| Surfshark | ✅ | ❌ | $3 | ⭐⭐☆☆☆ |

**Still inferior to home egress** - these will eventually be detected by corporate security systems.

## Enterprise VPN Compatibility (Cisco AnyConnect)

### The Challenge

Your company's Cisco AnyConnect VPN can conflict with other VPNs, causing:

- "Multiple VPN detected" errors
- Connection failures
- DNS resolution issues
- MTU (packet size) problems

### The Solution: Router-Level Tunneling

**Key Principle**: Keep AnyConnect on your work MacBook, but run Tailscale/WireGuard on your travel router.

```
Work MacBook → AnyConnect → Corporate Network
     ↓
GL.iNet Router → Tailscale → Home Network
     ↓
Personal MacBook → Normal browsing
```

### Configuration Steps

1. **On Work MacBook**:
   - Install AnyConnect normally
   - Connect to corporate VPN
   - AnyConnect sees "normal" home Wi-Fi

2. **On GL.iNet Router**:
   - Configure Tailscale/WireGuard
   - Router handles location masking
   - Work MacBook unaware of tunneling

3. **DNS Configuration**:
   - Set router DNS to home network DNS
   - Prevents DNS leaks
   - AnyConnect DNS takes precedence for corporate resources

### Troubleshooting AnyConnect Issues

**Problem**: AnyConnect detects other VPN
**Solution**: Ensure only one VPN active per device

**Problem**: DNS resolution fails
**Solution**: Check DNS order in network settings

**Problem**: Slow connection speeds
**Solution**: Adjust MTU settings (try 1420 or 1380)

## Hardware Restrictions & Wireless Device Warnings

### Critical: No Wireless Peripherals During Work

**Golden Rule**: All wireless connections must remain disabled during work hours. Use Ethernet for network, wired peripherals for input/audio, and isolate phone on mobile data.

### Headset: Sennheiser Momentum 4

**❌ AVOID:**
- **Never use Bluetooth mode** - Bluetooth broadcasts your device MAC address and can be detected by endpoint monitoring tools
- **Never use USB dongles that pair wirelessly** - these still transmit RF signals and can be detected as Bluetooth devices

**✅ SAFE USE:**
- **Use wired mode ONLY**: Connect using 3.5mm cable directly to laptop
- **If laptop lacks 3.5mm port**: Use USB-C to 3.5mm DAC adapter (digital audio converter)
- **Recommended adapters**: Apple USB-C to 3.5mm ($9), Anker USB-C Audio Adapter ($13)

**Why this matters**: Corporate endpoint monitoring tools can detect Bluetooth devices even if you think they're "just headphones". The Momentum 4 has a detachable cable - use it!

### Mouse: Logitech MX Master 3

**❌ AVOID:**
- **Never use Bluetooth mode** - wireless RF transmission breaks your isolation
- **Never use Logitech Unifying Receiver** - even though it's not "Bluetooth", it still uses 2.4GHz RF wireless that can be detected by monitoring tools
- **Both methods transmit wireless signals** that endpoint security can detect

**✅ SAFE ALTERNATIVES:**
1. **Use laptop trackpad** temporarily during work hours (free, 100% safe)
2. **Get a wired mouse**:
   - Logitech G203 Wired Gaming Mouse ($25) - excellent sensor, durable
   - Razer DeathAdder Essential ($20) - ergonomic, reliable
   - Any basic USB wired mouse ($10-15)

**Why this matters**: The Unifying Receiver uses RF 2.4GHz wireless, which is just as detectable as Bluetooth. Corporate security tools scan for ALL wireless transmissions, not just Bluetooth specifically.

### Phone: Teams/Slack Integration

**❌ AVOID:**
- **Never connect phone to work laptop** via USB tethering, Wi-Fi hotspot, or Bluetooth
- **Never use phone hotspot** for laptop internet connection (even though it's convenient)
- **Never log into work accounts from phone's non-VPN IP** - this creates a foreign IP login in the audit logs

**✅ SAFE USE:**
1. **Keep phone on mobile data only** - never connect to work laptop
2. **Use phone as passive alert device**: Monitor Teams/Slack notifications on mobile app
3. **If you need to respond**:
   - Use mobile app via cellular data ONLY
   - Avoid video calls or screen sharing from phone (creates non-VPN connection logs)
4. **Never log into work accounts** from phone when traveling unless absolutely necessary
5. **If you must use phone for work**:
   - Only for reading notifications/messages
   - Reply with "I'll check on my laptop" instead of responding directly

**Why this matters**: Every time you connect your phone to the laptop, you create a new network interface that can leak your real location. Teams/Slack mobile apps also report location metadata.

### Summary: Wired-Only Work Setup

When working remotely:

| Device | Status | Connection Method |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| **Laptop Network** | ✅ | Ethernet cable to GL.iNet router |
| **Laptop Bluetooth** | ❌ OFF | Disabled in System Preferences |
| **Laptop Wi-Fi** | ❌ OFF | Disabled in System Preferences |
| **Headset (Momentum 4)** | ✅ | 3.5mm wired cable (or USB-C DAC) |
| **Mouse (MX Master 3)** | ❌ | Replace with wired mouse or use trackpad |
| **Phone** | ⚠️ ISOLATED | Mobile data only, no connection to laptop |
| **Airplane Mode** | ✅ | Enable when possible to disable all radios |

## App-by-App Hardening & Hygiene

### macOS System Settings

1. **Time Zone**:
   - System Preferences → Date & Time
   - Set to "São Paulo" (UTC-3)
   - **Never change while traveling** - maintain timezone consistency
   - Ensure system clock syncs with Brazil timezone to prevent timestamp anomalies in logs

2. **Location Services**:
   - System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Privacy → Location Services
   - **Disable all location services** during work hours
   - Prevents apps from detecting your actual location via GPS
   - Apple can detect location via Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and telemetry even without GPS

3. **Account Sync** (Critical):
   - System Preferences → Internet Accounts
   - **Disable or limit sync** for Google, Apple, and Microsoft accounts during travel
   - iCloud sync can leak location data through device timestamps
   - Google account sync shares timezone and device location
   - Microsoft 365 sync may trigger location-based security alerts

4. **Wireless Radios** (Most Important):
   - **Disable Bluetooth completely** when working
   - **Disable Wi-Fi on work laptop** - use Ethernet only
   - **Enable Airplane Mode** when possible to disable all radios
   - Menu Bar → Bluetooth → Turn Bluetooth Off
   - Menu Bar → Wi-Fi → Turn Wi-Fi Off
   - This prevents geo-databases from triangulating your location

5. **Network Profiles**:
   - Create separate profiles for home vs travel
   - Home profile: normal settings
   - Travel profile: use router's DNS, Ethernet-only

6. **Browser Configuration**:
   - Use separate browser profiles
   - Disable WebRTC in Chrome: `chrome://flags/#disable-webrtc`
   - Use Firefox with `media.peerconnection.enabled = false`

### Microsoft Teams Optimization

1. **Location Settings**:
   - Teams → Settings → Privacy
   - Verify location shows "Uberaba, Brazil"

2. **Network Detection**:
   - Teams may detect network changes
   - Use consistent Wi-Fi network name
   - Avoid switching between networks frequently

3. **Camera/Audio Setup**:
   - Test camera before important meetings
   - Use external microphone for better audio
   - Consider virtual background to hide location

### Zoom Configuration

1. **Location Verification**:
   - Zoom → Settings → General
   - Check "Show my location" setting

2. **Network Optimization**:
   - Enable "Use TCP for audio"
   - Disable "Use TCP for video" (unless needed)

### Slack Settings

1. **Timezone Consistency**:
   - Slack → Preferences → Notifications
   - Set timezone to São Paulo

2. **Status Management**:
   - Use consistent status messages
   - Avoid location-specific status updates

### Social Media & Behavioral Hygiene

**Critical**: Your colleagues follow you on social media. One Instagram story from Tokyo can undo all your technical setup!

1. **Posting Restrictions**:
   - **Never post location-based content** while traveling (no geotags, no landmarks, no timezone reveals)
   - **Avoid posting during work hours** in different timezones (posting at 2 AM "Brazil time" is suspicious)
   - **Schedule posts** to appear during normal Brazil hours (8 AM - 10 PM Brazil time)
   - **Review photo metadata** - remove EXIF data with GPS coordinates before posting

2. **Story/Status Controls**:
   - **Restrict coworkers from viewing stories** during travel
   - Instagram: Settings → Privacy → Story → Hide story from [select coworkers]
   - Facebook: Settings → Privacy → Story → Custom → Don't share with [select coworkers]
   - **Alternative**: Don't post stories at all during travel period

3. **Timezone Betrayals to Avoid**:
   - Posting "Good morning!" at 2 AM Brazil time
   - Commenting on posts during Brazil nighttime hours
   - Online gaming/activity during "sleep hours"
   - Last seen timestamps on WhatsApp/Telegram

4. **Background Reveals**:
   - Be careful with video call backgrounds (virtual backgrounds recommended)
   - Hotel rooms, airport signs, foreign power outlets in photos
   - Language on signs/menus visible in background
   - Foreign currency, SIM cards, or travel items in frame

### Work Pattern Consistency

Maintain normal work behaviors to avoid raising flags:

1. **Meeting Schedule**:
   - Keep same meeting times aligned with Brazil timezone
   - Don't schedule meetings at "convenient local times" that would be odd for Brazil
   - If you normally attend 9 AM Brazil meetings, keep attending at 9 AM Brazil time

2. **Response Patterns**:
   - Maintain same response time patterns
   - If you normally respond within 15 minutes during work hours, keep doing that
   - Don't suddenly become a "night owl" responding at 2 AM Brazil time

3. **Break Schedules**:
   - Take breaks at normal Brazil times (lunch 12-1 PM, etc.)
   - Don't take lunch at 3 AM Brazil time because it's noon locally

4. **Calendar Management**:
   - Keep calendar in Brazil timezone
   - Mark "out of office" only if you would normally do so
   - Don't block off unusual hours that reveal different timezone

## Validation and Monitoring

### Daily Checks

Run these tests every morning:

1. **IP Address Check**:

   ```bash
   curl ifconfig.me
   ```

   Should show your home IP

   - Microsoft 365 admin center
   - Review sign-in locations
   - Should show consistent Brazil location

2. **Review AnyConnect Logs**:
   - Check for connection issues
   - Monitor for "VPN detected" warnings

3. **Test Banking Apps**:
   - Verify access to Brazilian banking
   - Check for location-based restrictions

### Emergency Rollback

If location is detected:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Disconnect from travel router
   - Use iPhone hotspot directly
   - Contact IT with "technical issues" excuse

2. **Damage Control**:
   - Claim "VPN for personal use"
   - Mention "security concerns while traveling"
   - Offer to disable VPN for work

3. **Prevention**:
   - Review detection method
   - Adjust configuration
   - Test thoroughly before reconnecting
